# Knight
This is simple game "Knight in the dungeon". This game is my final project in the course 
"Object oriented programming and patterns in Python" by MIPT and Mail.ru.
In this game the following patterns are implemented: observer, decorator, chain of responsibility, abstract factory.
All logic and engine was already implemented. 
You can run this game by command "python Main.py"
